## 🌌 Overview

`extrapolation_photometry` is a scientific photometry pipeline developed to automate and enhance the process of circular aperture photometry and extrapolation fitting, especially for time-series astronomical data.

This project includes:
- Object detection based on user-defined neighbors
- Cropping of astronomical targets (target, comparison, check stars)
- Circular aperture photometry with customizable radii
- Extrapolation fitting with visualized results
- Exported results in `.csv` with structured folder outputs

Designed to support both **GUI-based workflows** and **script-based analysis**, this tool is well-suited for undergraduate and graduate research in astrophysics and observational astronomy.
